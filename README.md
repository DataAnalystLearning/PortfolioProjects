A seasoned system administrator moving into the world of Data Analytics.  I'll be hosting my projects here as I progress and gain more skills and experience.
To kick off I have created an Interactive Dashboard in Excel (Junior School Dashboard) using Pivot Tables and Slicers.  Its gone really well and is used for my IT Health Audits.

I then followed that up by creating a Tableau Dashboard of the school's floor plan.  I had a go at linking the devices to the floor plan and this worked ok, as a bonus I managed to colour coordinate the KPI's as well.  I think the presentation could be improved though so I may be come back to it but the process works which was my goal.

Next I opened SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and imprted the excel file that houses the Junior School Data.  There were some empty columns so I removed those and then used some basic commands to query the data.

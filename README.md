A seasoned system administrator moving into the world of Data Analytics.  I'll be hosting my projects here as I progress and gain more skills and experience.
To kick off I have created an Interactive Dashboard in Excel (Junior School Dashboard) using Pivot Tables and Slicers.  Its gone really well and is used for my IT Health Audits.

I then followed that up by creating a Tableau Dashboard of the school's floor plan.  I had a go at linking the devices to the floor plan and this worked ok, as a bonus I managed to colour coordinate the KPI's as well.  I think the presentation could be improved though so I may be come back to it but the process works which was my goal.

Next I opened SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and imprted the excel file that houses the Junior School Data.  There were some empty columns so I removed those and then used some basic commands to query the data.

Agter using SQL I then moved on to Python and used Pandas to remove excess NULL columns and then remove the some of the data that contained NaN.  Lastly I used basic commands to narrow down what devices are in need of replacing according to the data.

My final project was to use Power BI and create several visualisations.  Some of them I used Conditional Formatting to colour co-ordinate bwtweeen them.  I placed a slicer on the page rather than use a filter on the side Menu and on one of the charts I created a simple Measure for the Card Visual to show a percentage value.

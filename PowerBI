This is my final project on using the Junior School Data.
I used Power BI to create several visualisations. On some of them I used Conditional Formatting to colour co-ordinate bwtweeen them. 
I placed a slicer on the page rather than use a filter on the side Menu and on one of the charts I created a simple Measure for the Card Visual to show a percentage value.
